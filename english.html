            <p>
                Hello, nice to meet you. I'm Riwon.
                My nickname may be a bit difficult to pronounce,
                but I chose it because, in a way, it means 'Good has always won.'
                Like my nickname, my main interest—Educational Technology—may seem a bit unfamiliar at first.
                However, I have been passionate about education since I was young.
                This passion deepened when I earned my teaching certification in college.
                After gaining firsthand experience in the education field,
                I wanted to develop programs that could further support education.
                To achieve this, I pursued a double major in computer science
                from my fourth year until graduation, embarking on my journey as a programmer.
                In the future, I hope to become a programmer who can create educational solutions
                that empower dreamers to achieve their own dreams.
            </p>

                <p>
                    I have been reading English literature,
                    from classics to modern works, since my college days.
                    I was drawn to the fact that every word in literature
                    offers inspiration and new insights to its readers.
                    These writings serve not just as tools for communication,
                    but also play an important role in creating new values
                    by connecting people and offering a shared perspective on the world.
                    Moreover, based on the culture and history reflected in the pages,
                    I believe literature helps us reflect on the past and present world,
                    and even imagine the future.
                    Among them, the most memorable work is Dead Poets Society.
                    The original script was written by Tom Schulman and later novelized by Nancy Kleinbaum.
                    This work is so famous that many people are familiar with its story
                    through the 'O, Captain! My Captain!' verse of Walt Whitman.
                    Through this work, I was once again reminded of the value of education and,
                    even more so, the way individuals live their lives.

                <h4>Life-Changing Music</h4>
                <div class="thumbnail">
                    <img
                        src="./images/song1.jpg"
                        width="200"
                        alt="Time to Say Goodbye"
                    />
                </div>
                <p>
                    Music has the power to soothe and breathe new life into our hearts at different times.
                    Among all the songs, my favorite is 'Time to Say Goodbye.'
                    The original title, 'Con te partiro', was released by the world-renowned tenor
                    Andrea Bocelli on his first album Bocelli in 1995.
                    The following year, a version sung by Sarah Brightman was released.
                    Perhaps because the two voices blend together,
                    I believe the new version has a more touching effect on listeners than the original.
                    Though the title suggests a farewell,
                    the Italian lyrics actually mean 'Let's leave together',
                    implying not an ending, but a new beginning.
                    When I listen to this song, I take time to reflect on my experiences
                    and prepare for the next step in my life.
